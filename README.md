# Identify-Fraud-from-Enron-Email
A project I worked on recently is to identify fraud from Enron email. At first I develop python code to read the data from API. This data set has 146 data points with 21 features. The feature “poi” is the label for this study to identify that a person is a poi or not. My job is to make a classifier to decide whether a person is a poi or not. 
Based on an overall statistical overview for this dataset, I audit the data set to remove the outlier. Besides that, the features and labels are organized. I also create two new features based on the study. Based on the “scikit-learn” class, I use the “pipeline”, “SelectKBest”, and “gridsearchCV” method to decide how many features should be selected for this model. Considering the majority of data points are non-poi, I choose “Stratified-KFold” cross-validation method to evaluate the model performance. Besides that, the precision and recall parameter are applied to evaluate the classifier performance. Through the comparison between difference method such as naïve byes and decision tree, I choose the decision tree for this study. Through the parameter tuning for the decision tree model, final I obtain a classifier with precision score and recall score which are both higher than 0.5.
